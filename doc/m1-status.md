# Milestone 1: status and decisions log

What is decided, what is running, and what is left, kept current so the work
survives a lost session. Newest first within each section. Specs live in
`doc/hardware/`; this file points at them.

## Decisions carried forward (2026-09-25–27)

- BASIC is a loadable program at $7000, loaded from SD or the ROM fallback;
  networking stays in the kernel (`proposals/basic-program.md`,
  `proposals/kernel-api.md`). Keep BASIC's checksum on reload.
- Banked RAM is 512 KB with the $8000–$bfff window selected by RAM_BANK
  (`proposals/extended-ram.md`). SRAM A16–A18 must be connected.
- USB console uses the system card's second CDC port, with the documented
  timeout (`proposals/usb-console.md`).
- The native emulator runs Wi-Fi QEMU in lockstep. The 125 MIPS versus
  160 MHz approximation is recorded in `emu/machine/README.md`.
- M1's e-ink display is the Waveshare 7.5-inch HAT V2
  (`hardware/eink-card.md`).
- Main board: six layers; POWER and RESET at the front, machine initially
  off, system card unpowered while off (`hardware/power.md`). Eight layers
  would need a new cost decision. Preserve socket alignment and mounting
  geometry while opening routing channels.
- All eight boards need assembled parts, stock at twice the order quantity,
  branding/revision and the common LED placement. Final stock is checked
  online. David performs the fabrication hand checks and places the order.

## Decisions (David, 2026-09-24)

- **Card form factor:** the CPU card has the I/O card outline (62 × 39.05 mm
  above the tab) on its x8 tab; on the main board the CPU socket is first,
  then the six I/O slots, one row, all aligned. The system card keeps its
  own shape, its socket off to one side (`slot.md`, `cpu-bus.md`).

- **Power: the full M1 machine requires a USB-C 3.0 A source** (four cards
  no longer fit 1.5 A with margin). Below 3 A the radio stays off and SD
  writes are refused. The power agent re-derives the CC threshold, the
  input switch/fuse and the POW/THM checks; the main board takes its parts
  from `hw/power/design.py`.

- **E-ink card: built for M1** as the second graphics option (replaces the
  HDMI card, type $01; `proposals/eink-gpu.md` Decisions; pins `eink_mcu`).
  The native emulator gets a UC8179 panel model.

- **Storage card** (card type $04, `hardware/storage-card.md`): a separate
  RP2040 card for files, microSD in M1, a medium-neutral protocol so a later
  card can be tape or a hard disk. Replaces the microSD on the IO card
  (`proposals/io-microsd.md`, superseded). FatFs on the card, `SAVE` writes
  text, 4 handles. The IO card stays keyboard only.
- **Earlier e-ink exploration decision superseded:** the e-ink card is included in M1.
- **Native emulator** (`emu/`) is the emulator from now on; the JS one
  (`test/emu/machine.mjs`) is legacy and not kept up to date. Another agent
  owns `emu/`'s core work.
- **Card bevel 30°** (JLC's nearest to CEM's 20° ± 5°), a written waiver
  (`hardware/fab-waivers.md`).
- **Wi-Fi antenna**: MHF III-to-SMA lead C709347 and SMA antenna C1509156,
  both loose from JLC (the module's receptacle is MHF III, not U.FL).
- **Out of scope**: a missing CPU card (broken hardware); cards plugged or
  pulled while powered (`slot.md`).
- **LEDs**: a power LED in the same place on every board, other LEDs in a
  row along the top edge, TX/RX LEDs where data leaves a board
  (`milestone-1.md`, Indicator LEDs).
- **Board revision** on every board's silkscreen and title block.

## In flight (2026-09-27)

| Work | State |
|---|---|
| Main board | Existing main-board branch: six-layer layout; pin remap, modest outline growth, fine signal rules and ten routing workers approved. Routing is incomplete. |
| BASIC follow-ups | Packed ROM image, approved dead-code removals, run/hook handshake, isolated Nim cache and assembler comment parsing. Simulator checks precede emulator checks. |
| Board verification | Wire static/power/thermal catalogue rows and add storage, e-ink and system rows with checks that reject missing evidence. |
| SI and schematic co-simulation | Still required by verification.md; routed crosstalk screening alone does not satisfy analog SI. Main-board trace extraction waits for routing. |
| Final gate | Run make verify after integration; regenerate fab-readiness; inspect renders and list David's hand checks. No manufacturing upload or order. |

## Done (recent)

- CPU card now uses six layers. The seven card pipelines were reported complete
  at handoff; final integration reruns and live stock checks remain required.
- SD card model in the native emulator (EMU-008), STO-003, E2E-007 (BASIC
  SAVE/LOAD on the whole machine).
- Storage card software: FatFs core, RP2040 port, kernel/BASIC, 2668 host
  checks, KRN-006.
- Power for four cards and a 3 A source: TPS259470 eFuse, 3.5 A PTC,
  TLV62569PDDCR, PWR_HI = 3.0 A; below it no radio and no SD writes.

- Wi-Fi card board through the whole pipeline (WIFI-004), TLV62569 buck
  after POW-003/THM-001, TX/RX/LINK LEDs, standard outline.
- `cupc8.py` resyncs on a PING nonce (a killed run's late reply no longer
  passes for the next run's; HOST-002).
- Keyboard path on the whole machine: IO card serves the slot during USB
  enumeration; boot ROM and kernel retry a not-ready READ.
- Power/thermal (4.4/4.5), footprint/pinout/rotation (4.3, BRD-001),
  mechanical fit (4.7, MECH-*), fab readiness report (`make verify`).

## Left before ordering

- All boards through the pipeline; E2E-001 (co-sim from the netlists);
  E2E-002/003/004 green on the native emulator; SI (4.6); the fab-readiness
  hand checks; David's sign-off; the final design critique.
