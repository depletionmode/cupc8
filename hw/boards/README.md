# Board designs

Each board is a Python script that generates its KiCad schematic and PCB and
runs the whole pipeline in `hw/tools/kicadgen.py` (`pipeline()`):

1. schematic, ERC
2. netlist, board build, Freerouting
3. GND stitching, zone fill
4. silkscreen and 3D-model checks
5. DRC with schematic parity
6. Gerbers and drill
7. JLC BOM and CPL (every placed part carries an LCSC number), and `order.json`
8. 3D renders

Outputs land in `build/hw/<board>/`, and `fab/` holds what goes to JLCPCB.

```
python3 hw/boards/wifi.py
```

Shared rules:
- **Revision:** every board passes `title`, `revision` and `revision_at` to `pipeline()`, which prints `<title> rev <revision>` on the top silkscreen and puts the revision in the title block (and so in the Gerbers). Bump the board script's `REVISION` (A, B, ...) for every order that changes the board (`doc/milestone-1.md`, Board revision).
- **Cards:** 1.6 mm, with hard-gold fingers and a 45° chamfer. These are
  order options, written in `fab/order.json` and checked there.
- **Card edge:** each card's finger tab is KiCad's `BUS_PCIexpress_*`
  footprint. The script draws the body's outline and meets the tab where it
  starts.
- **Branding:** the Kaplan Labs logo on the top silkscreen of every board.
- **Assembly:** nothing is fitted by hand. The Wi-Fi card's U.FL antenna is
  the one exception: it is plugged in, not soldered.

## Wi-Fi card (`wifi.py`)

Spec: `doc/hardware/wifi-card.md`.

- **U1, ESP32-C3-MINI-1U-N4** (C2911374). The U.FL end sits at the card's top
  edge. The GPIOs follow `hw/pins.yaml`:
  - SCK: GPIO6
  - MOSI: GPIO7
  - MISO: GPIO5
  - CS_n: GPIO10
  - IRQ_n: GPIO3, open drain
  - LINK, TX and RX LEDs: GPIO4, GPIO0, GPIO1
- **U2, TLV62569DBVR buck** (C141836), fed from the slot's +5V, with L1
  2.2 µH (FNR3015S2R2MT, C167747), 22 µF in, 22 µF + 100 nF out, and a
  453k/100k feedback divider (3.32 V). An AMS1117 LDO failed the power
  checks: in a TX burst at the worst-case corner it left the ESP32-C3 at
  2.71 V (3.0 V minimum), and it ran at Tj ≈ 120 °C (`hw/power`, POW-003,
  THM-001). The slot's +3V3 pins are left unconnected: Wi-Fi TX peaks near
  350 mA, and the slot's +3V3 is limited to 300 mA.
- **U3, 74LVC1G125** (C52140430). Its /OE is CS_n, so the card drives the
  shared MISO line only while it is selected.
- **EN:** 10 kΩ / 1 µF RC, per Espressif. CARD_RST_n, which is open drain on
  the main board, pulls it low.
- **Straps:** GPIO9 has a 10 kΩ pull-up and PROG_n pulls it low for the ROM
  bootloader. GPIO8 and GPIO2 each have a 10 kΩ pull-up and carry nothing
  else.
- **Programming port:** SWCLK drives U0RXD and SWDIO carries U0TXD. esptool
  runs through sysctl's UART tunnel.
- **LEDs:** power at the standard spot (red: a green LED drops ~3 V, too
  close to the 3.3 V rail for 1 kΩ), then LINK (GPIO4), TX (GPIO0) and RX
  (GPIO1) in a row with it along the top edge, green with 100 Ω. TX and RX light for 30 ms whenever
  socket data moves.
- **Outline:** the standard I/O card outline, with its M3 hole
  (`slot.md`, Mechanical).
- **Test pads** for the native USB-Serial/JTAG (GPIO18/19). They are for
  debugging only.
- **PRSNT1_n (A1) is joined to PRSNT2_n (B18).** The RSVD pins are left
  unconnected.

## CPU card (`cpu.py`)

    python3 hw/boards/cpu.py            # outputs in build/hw/cpu

The M1 CPU card: `cpu.vhd` in an iCE40HX4K-TQ144 on the PCIe-x8-style CPU
socket ([cpu-bus.md](../../doc/hardware/cpu-bus.md)). It boots from its own
W25Q32JVSSIQ, which the system card reprograms through the socket (FL1 bus,
CRESET_n, CDONE; [system-slot.md](../../doc/hardware/system-slot.md)).

- **FPGA pins** are read from `hw/pins.yaml` (`cpu_fpga`), the file that also
  generates `build/hw/cpucard.pcf`, so the schematic and the bitstream agree
  by construction. The bank-2 bus pins run bottom to top in the fingers'
  left-to-right order: /RST, /STB, /RDY, RW, SYNC, D0–D4, CLK (GBIN5, pin 49),
  D5–D7, TMR_EXP0/1, HALTED, WAITING. That way only CPU_CLK crosses other bus
  lines on the way to the socket. In the first pin order the control lines
  crossed all eight data lines, and Freerouting could not route them.
- **Footprints** are JLC's own (`jlc:`, imported from the LCSC part) for the
  FPGA, the flash and the resistor arrays, so the BOM check (BRD-001) matches
  them pad for pad. The pin tables are in `hw/parts/`. The FPGA's table is
  Lattice's HX4K TQ144 pinout. All 144 pins were cross-checked against
  KiCad's symbol and icestorm's chipdb. EasyEDA's symbol for C1521989 has
  another device's pin names, and nothing uses it.
- **Power** (Lattice FPGA-TN-02006, the iCE40 hardware checklist). VCC 1V2
  comes from an RT9013-12GB off the socket's +3V3. All four VCCIO banks,
  SPI_VCC and VPP_2V5 are on 3V3; VPP_2V5 may be 2.5–3.3 V when the FPGA
  boots from SPI flash. The PLLs are unused, but each VCCPLL still gets
  100 Ω + 4.7 µF + 100 nF, as the checklist asks. The caps go to that PLL's
  own GNDPLL pin, which is *not* joined to board ground. VPP_FAST is left
  open. Each supply pin has 100 nF beside it, and each rail group has 4.7 µF.
  The card takes nothing from +5V.
- **Configuration.** SPI_SS_B and SPI_SCK are pulled up (controller mode).
  CRESET_B and CDONE are pulled up on the card as well as on the main board.
  /WP and /HOLD are pulled high, because the FPGA uses plain 0x0B reads.
- **Bus.** Every card output (A, D, RW, /STB, SYNC, TMR_EXP, HALTED,
  WAITING) has 33 Ω at the driver: eight 4D03 arrays, 4 × 33 Ω each.
  CPU_CLK and the other inputs go straight to the FPGA.
- **Straps.** CARD_ID = `10`: CARD_ID0 goes to GND, and CARD_ID1 is left to
  the main board's pull-up. PRSNT1_n is joined to PRSNT2_n.
- **1V2 rail LED** ([power.md](../../doc/hardware/power.md)). 1.2 V cannot
  light an LED, so an MMBT3904 driven from 1V2 switches a red LED on 3V3.
  There are test pads for 1V2, 3V3 and GND.
- **Stackup.** 4 layers, JLC04161H-7628, 1.6 mm, with hard-gold 45° fingers.
  The layers are signal + GND pour / GND plane / 3V3 plane / signal + GND
  pour. 1V2 is routed as tracks. With a TQ144 there
  are 16 supply pins on all four sides, plus 31 series-terminated bus lines
  and the clock. Two planes give every one of them a short via to its supply
  and a solid return path under the whole bus, without cutting up a pour. On
  two layers the fan-out would have to share its layers with the power.
- **Placement.** The FPGA's bank 3 (A[15:0], IRQ) faces the fingers. Bank 2
  (control, D, timers, config) faces right. The eight 33 Ω arrays run in one
  row under the package, in the fingers' order: A, then /STB-RW-SYNC, D0–3,
  D4–7 and the timer lines. The flash sits by the config pins, top right,
  clear of the M3 hole. The PWR LED is at the common spot, 3 mm in from the
  top-left corner. Nothing sits in the 4.5 mm strip above the fingers.
