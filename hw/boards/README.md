# Board designs

Each board is a Python script that generates its KiCad schematic and PCB and
runs the whole pipeline in `hw/tools/kicadgen.py` (`pipeline()`):

1. schematic, ERC
2. netlist, board build, Freerouting
3. GND stitching, zone fill
4. silkscreen and 3D-model checks
5. DRC with schematic parity
6. Gerbers and drill
7. JLC BOM and CPL (every placed part carries an LCSC number), and `order.json`
8. 3D renders

Outputs land in `build/hw/<board>/`, and `fab/` holds what goes to JLCPCB.

```

Shared rules:
- **Revision:** every board passes `title`, `revision` and `revision_at` to `pipeline()`, which prints `<title> rev <revision>` on the top silkscreen and puts the revision in the title block (and so in the Gerbers). Bump the board script's `REVISION` (A, B, ...) for every order that changes the board (`doc/milestone-1.md`, Board revision).
- **Cards:** 1.6 mm, with hard-gold fingers and a 45° chamfer. These are
  order options, written in `fab/order.json` and checked there.
- **Card edge:** each card's finger tab is KiCad's `BUS_PCIexpress_*`
  footprint. The script draws the body's outline and meets the tab where it
  starts.
- **Branding:** the Kaplan Labs logo on the top silkscreen of every board.
- **Assembly:** nothing is fitted by hand. The Wi-Fi card's U.FL antenna is
  the one exception: it is plugged in, not soldered.

## Wi-Fi card (`wifi.py`)

Spec: `doc/hardware/wifi-card.md`.

- **U1, ESP32-C3-MINI-1U-N4** (C2911374). The U.FL end sits at the card's top
  edge. The GPIOs follow `hw/pins.yaml`:
  - SCK: GPIO6
  - MOSI: GPIO7
  - MISO: GPIO5
  - CS_n: GPIO10
  - IRQ_n: GPIO3, open drain
  - LINK, TX and RX LEDs: GPIO4, GPIO0, GPIO1
- **U2, TLV62569DBVR buck** (C141836), fed from the slot's +5V, with L1
  2.2 µH (FNR3015S2R2MT, C167747), 22 µF in, 22 µF + 100 nF out, and a
  453k/100k feedback divider (3.32 V). An AMS1117 LDO failed the power
  checks: in a TX burst at the worst-case corner it left the ESP32-C3 at
  2.71 V (3.0 V minimum), and it ran at Tj ≈ 120 °C (`hw/power`, POW-003,
  THM-001). The slot's +3V3 pins are left unconnected: Wi-Fi TX peaks near
  350 mA, and the slot's +3V3 is limited to 300 mA.
- **U3, 74LVC1G125** (C52140430). Its /OE is CS_n, so the card drives the
  shared MISO line only while it is selected.
- **EN:** 10 kΩ / 1 µF RC, per Espressif. CARD_RST_n, which is open drain on
  the main board, pulls it low.
- **Straps:** GPIO9 has a 10 kΩ pull-up and PROG_n pulls it low for the ROM
  bootloader. GPIO8 and GPIO2 each have a 10 kΩ pull-up and carry nothing
  else.
- **Programming port:** SWCLK drives U0RXD and SWDIO carries U0TXD. esptool
  runs through sysctl's UART tunnel.
- **LEDs:** power at the standard spot (red: a green LED drops ~3 V, too
  close to the 3.3 V rail for 1 kΩ), then LINK (GPIO4), TX (GPIO0) and RX
  (GPIO1) in a row, green with 100 Ω. TX and RX light for 30 ms whenever
  socket data moves.
- **Outline:** the standard I/O card outline, with its M3 hole
  (`slot.md`, Mechanical).
- **Test pads** for the native USB-Serial/JTAG (GPIO18/19). They are for
  debugging only.
- **PRSNT1_n (A1) is joined to PRSNT2_n (B18).** The RSVD pins are left
  unconnected.
